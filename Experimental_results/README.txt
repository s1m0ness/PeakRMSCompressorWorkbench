Experimental Results Reproducibility

The results are obtained by running predefined compressor presets on a fixed set of audio files and extracting objective compression metrics in offline mode.

The experimental evaluation uses the following dedicated audio files, each representing a different track category:

Please_Mr._Postman_[02_Drum_Kit].wav        → Drums preset
Please_Mr._Postman_[03_Bass].wav            → Bass preset
Please_Mr._Postman_[04_Acoustic_Guitar].wav → Guitar preset
Please_Mr._Postman_[07_Lead_Vocal].wav      → Vocal preset
Please_Mr._Postman_[full_mix(demo)].wav     → Full mix preset
